(2008)](https://doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v56i2.5605) and [Medina-Reyna (2001)](https://perma.cc/3RZ7-PPJH) that shrimp in the wild are found at densities between 0.001 and 4.9 individuals per m^2^ as a reference value, assuming that this density range represents shrimp preferences.\n\nWe use the stocking densities from Table 3 of our main report to compare the wild shrimp densities with that of different farm types: - Extensive: \\~\\<5 to 20 post-larvae per m^2^ - Semi-intensive: \\~5 to 40 post-larvae per m^2^ - Intensive: \\~40 to 130 post-larvae per m^2^ - Super-intensive: \\~130 to \\>300 post-larvae per m^2^\n\n## Prevalence\n\nStocking density increases with increasing farm intensity.\n\nExtensive farms use low densities but may still have shrimp at somewhat higher levels than their wild counterparts. We think intensive and super-intensive farms are definitely using high densities, since it is a defining feature of these farm types.\n\nOur estimates are:\n\n| **Extensive**      | **Semi-intensive**  | **Intensive** | **Super-intensive** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 25--75% (mean 50%) | 75--100% (mean 80%) | 100%          | 100%                |\n\n```{r}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.5, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.25, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.75)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.8, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.75, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n```{r}\nprev_dens_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.99, 0.99),\n                               sd = c(0.1516166, 0.03818779, 0.001, 0.001))\nprev_dens_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_dens_stat$mean, prev_dens_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_dens_dist)<-prev_dens_stat$FarmType\nprev_dens_dist[,3:4] <- 1\n\nprev_dens<-as.data.frame(prev_dens_dist)\n```\n\n## Pain-Tracks\n\n![](images/density.png)\n\nPercentages marked with \\* assume death from cannibalism happens roughly every four weeks and causes one minute of excruciating and disabling pain together when it does happen.\n\nPercentage marked with \\*\\* assumes death from cannibalism happens once every eight weeks and causes one minute of excruciating and disabling pain together when it does happen.\n\n```{r}\ndur_dens_ext<-24\ndur_dens_semi<-24\ndur_dens_int<-24\ndur_dens_super<-24\n\npain_dens_ext<-data.frame(\n  Excruciating = 0,\n  Disabling = 0) %>% \n  cbind(sample_dirichlet(0, 0, 10, 90)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n\npain_dens_semi<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.000625, 0.000625, 10, 89.99875)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n\npain_dens_int<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.00125, 0.00125, 15, 84.9975)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories) \n\npain_dens_super<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.00125, 0.00125, 20, 79.9975)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n```\n\nCombine the intensity and duration information\n\n```{r}\npaintrack_dens_ext<-(dur_dens_ext * pain_dens_ext)\n\npaintrack_dens_semi<-(dur_dens_semi * pain_dens_semi)\n\npaintrack_dens_int<-(dur_dens_int * pain_dens_int)\n\npaintrack_dens_super<-(dur_dens_super * pain_dens_super)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Duration notes\n\nWe assume high densities, where present, are present for the whole of a shrimp's life. Some shrimp farmers conduct partial harvests or reduce stocking density as shrimp get larger, so we add some uncertainty.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\nHigh densities seem to reduce growth  and lower immune function even when water quality parameters are carefully controlled ([Liu et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.05.038); [da Silveira et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12718)). This finding is consistent with shrimp experiencing negative welfare due to the chronic stress of crowding and suffering adverse health effects as a byproduct.\n\nCannibalism rates may also be higher in higher stocking density environments, at least for *P. monodon* ([Abdussamad & Thampy, 1994](https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5)).\n\nIn terms of behavioral restrictions, [da Costa et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550) report that retreat behaviors decrease when density increases---shrimp may prefer to be away from others but cannot do so at higher stocking densities as retreating would just put them close to other individuals. [Bardera et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735949) confirmed that there are consistent individual differences in *P. vannamei* regarding which shrimp avoid contact with other shrimp at densities that are representative of extensive and semi-intensive conditions. The formation of such hierarchies likely involves conflicts that are mostly negative, especially for losing individuals.\n\nWe attempt to account for the fact that shrimp may be on higher alert when in higher stocking densities by having a large portion of the pain intensity in 'annoying'. Nevertheless, we apportion some pain to the 'hurtful' category to account for negative contact with other individuals and reduced access to resources, and to the 'disabling' and 'excruciating' categories for cannibalism and death.\n:::\n\nWeight the pain tracks by prevalence estimations and proportion of farming attributable to each farm type, as well as the average days lived by a shrimp.\n\n```{r}\ndens_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext = paintrack_dens_ext*prev_dens$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext*average_days_lived,\n  semi = paintrack_dens_semi*prev_dens$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi*average_days_lived,\n  int = paintrack_dens_int*prev_dens$Intensive*prop_sample$Int*average_days_lived,\n  super = paintrack_dens_super*prev_dens$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super*average_days_lived)\n```\n\nAdd the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n```{r}\ndens<-dens_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_dens <- dens %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_dens$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_dens$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_dens$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_dens$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_dens$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\ndensity_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_dens))\nrow.names(density_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_dens\",\"Hurtful_dens\",\"Disabling_dens\", \"Excruciating_dens\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_High_density\")\nshow_table(density_summary)\n\n```\n\n# Lack of substrate\n\nHere, we are considering both a lack of natural, burrowable substrate and a lack of artificial structures the shrimp can climb or cling to.\n\n## Prevalence\n\nEarthen ponds, typically used for extensive and sometimes semi-intensive ponds likely have a burrowable substrate on the pond bottom. Some semi-intensive ponds are lined with plastic, however. Intensive and super-intensive ponds are plastic or concrete lined, or are raised tanks, which would not have substrate available to shrimp.\n\n95% of semi-intensive farms in SWP's [India Scoping Report](https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/india-scoping-report) and the one intensive farm interviewed, said they had substrate where shrimps can bury themselves.\n\nUsing artificial screens or other structures shrimp can cling to is not standard practice in any farm type. It is possible that extensive and some semi-intensive ponds may have plants growing in them, which shrimp could use for this purpose, though we are very uncertain about this.\n\nOur prevalence estimates are:\n\n| **Extensive**    | **Semi-intensive** | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 0--15% (mean 5%) | 25--75% (mean 50%) | 90--100% (mean 95%) | 100%                |\n\n```{r}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.05, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.15)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.5, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.25, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.75)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.95, tol=1e-6, #sd_val=0.15,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.9, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n```{r}\nprev_subst_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 0.99),\n                               sd = c(0.07977766, 0.1516271, 0.0367738, 0.001))\nprev_subst_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_subst_stat$mean, prev_subst_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_subst_dist)<-prev_subst_stat$FarmType\nprev_subst_dist[,4]<-1\n\nprev_subst<-as.data.frame(prev_subst_dist)\n```\n\n## Pain-Tracks\n\nWhere no substrate is present, shrimp in different farming systems are likely to have the same experience so we do one pain track for all farm types. However, *P. monodon* burrow more than *P. vannamei* so we do species-specific pain-tracks, one for *P. vannamei* and other penaeids and one for *P. monodon*, then weight by the proportion of farmed shrimp that are that species or group. *P. monodon* would usually burrow for around half the day in the wild.\n\n![](images/substrate.png)\n\nDurations marked \\* assume death from cannibalism happens once every four weeks and causes one minute of excruciating and disabling pain together when it does.\n\n```{r}\ndur_subst<-12\n\npain_subst_vannamei<-data.frame(\n  Excruciating = 0,\n  Disabling = 0) %>%\n  cbind(sample_dirichlet(0, 0, 2, 98)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories) \n\npain_subst_monodon<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.0025, 0.0025, 29.995, 70)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n```\n\nCombine the intensity and duration information and weight by the proportion of farmed shrimp that are that species or group.\n\n```{r}\npaintrack_subst_vannamei<-(dur_subst * pain_subst_vannamei * (prop_allspecies_dof$van_prop+prop_allspecies_dof$otherpen_prop))\n\npaintrack_subst_monodon<-(dur_subst * pain_subst_monodon * prop_allspecies_dof$mon_prop)\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Duration notes\n\nIf no substrate is present, this will be the case for 100% of a shrimp's life.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\n*P. monodon* shrimp burrow daily in the wild ([FAO, 2023](https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W?type=standard)), so having no burrowable substrate probably behaviorally deprives them significantly. It is less clear to what extent *P. vannamei* burrow.\n\nWe, therefore, attribute most pain from a lack of substrate to 'annoying', with a small portion attributed to 'hurtful'. For *P. monodon*, we attribute half of the pain to 'hurtful' to account for not being able to express species-typical behaviors. We assign a tiny portion to 'disabling' and 'excruciating' because cannibalism incidences may be more common when no substrate is present, even at the same stocking density ([Abdussamad & Thampy, 1994](https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5)).\n:::\n\nWeight the pain tracks by prevalence estimations and proportion of farming attributable to each farm type, as well as the average days lived by a shrimp.\n\n```{r}\nsubst_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext*average_days_lived,\n  semi = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi*average_days_lived,\n  int = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$Intensive*prop_sample$Int*average_days_lived,\n  super = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super*average_days_lived)\n```\n\nAdd the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n```{r}\nsubst<-subst_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_subst <- subst %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_subst$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_subst$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_subst$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_subst$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_subst$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\nsubst_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_subst))\nrow.names(subst_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_subst\",\"Hurtful_subst\",\"Disabling_subst\", \"Excruciating_subst\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_Lack_of_substrate\")\nshow_table(subst_summary)\n\n```\n\n# Predators\n\n## Prevalence\n\nWe were unable to find estimates of the incidence of predators or data on how much mortality predators typically cause.

Some shrimp farmers conduct partial harvests or reduce stocking density as shrimp get larger, so we add some uncertainty.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\nHigh densities seem to reduce growth  and lower immune function even when water quality parameters are carefully controlled ([Liu et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.05.038); [da Silveira et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12718)). This finding is consistent with shrimp experiencing negative welfare due to the chronic stress of crowding and suffering adverse health effects as a byproduct.\n\nCannibalism rates may also be higher in higher stocking density environments, at least for *P. monodon* ([Abdussamad & Thampy, 1994](https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5)).\n\nIn terms of behavioral restrictions, [da Costa et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550) report that retreat behaviors decrease when density increases---shrimp may prefer to be away from others but cannot do so at higher stocking densities as retreating would just put them close to other individuals. [Bardera et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735949) confirmed that there are consistent individual differences in *P. vannamei* regarding which shrimp avoid contact with other shrimp at densities that are representative of extensive and semi-intensive conditions. The formation of such hierarchies likely involves conflicts that are mostly negative, especially for losing individuals.\n\nWe attempt to account for the fact that shrimp may be on higher alert when in higher stocking densities by having a large portion of the pain intensity in 'annoying'. Nevertheless, we apportion some pain to the 'hurtful' category to account for negative contact with other individuals and reduced access to resources, and to the 'disabling' and 'excruciating' categories for cannibalism and death.\n:::\n\nWeight the pain tracks by prevalence estimations and proportion of farming attributable to each farm type, as well as the average days lived by a shrimp.\n\n```{r}\ndens_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext = paintrack_dens_ext*prev_dens$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext*average_days_lived,\n  semi = paintrack_dens_semi*prev_dens$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi*average_days_lived,\n  int = paintrack_dens_int*prev_dens$Intensive*prop_sample$Int*average_days_lived,\n  super = paintrack_dens_super*prev_dens$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super*average_days_lived)\n```\n\nAdd the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n```{r}\ndens<-dens_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_dens <- dens %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_dens$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_dens$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_dens$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_dens$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_dens$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\ndensity_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_dens$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_dens))\nrow.names(density_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_dens\",\"Hurtful_dens\",\"Disabling_dens\", \"Excruciating_dens\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_High_density\")\nshow_table(density_summary)\n\n```\n\n# Lack of substrate\n\nHere, we are considering both a lack of natural, burrowable substrate and a lack of artificial structures the shrimp can climb or cling to.\n\n## Prevalence\n\nEarthen ponds, typically used for extensive and sometimes semi-intensive ponds likely have a burrowable substrate on the pond bottom. Some semi-intensive ponds are lined with plastic, however. Intensive and super-intensive ponds are plastic or concrete lined, or are raised tanks, which would not have substrate available to shrimp.\n\n95% of semi-intensive farms in SWP's [India Scoping Report](https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/india-scoping-report) and the one intensive farm interviewed, said they had substrate where shrimps can bury themselves.\n\nUsing artificial screens or other structures shrimp can cling to is not standard practice in any farm type. It is possible that extensive and some semi-intensive ponds may have plants growing in them, which shrimp could use for this purpose, though we are very uncertain about this.\n\nOur prevalence estimates are:\n\n| **Extensive**    | **Semi-intensive** | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 0--15% (mean 5%) | 25--75% (mean 50%) | 90--100% (mean 95%) | 100%                |\n\n```{r}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.05, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.15)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.5, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.25, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.75)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.95, tol=1e-6, #sd_val=0.15,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.9, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n```{r}\nprev_subst_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 0.99),\n                               sd = c(0.07977766, 0.1516271, 0.0367738, 0.001))\nprev_subst_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_subst_stat$mean, prev_subst_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_subst_dist)<-prev_subst_stat$FarmType\nprev_subst_dist[,4]<-1\n\nprev_subst<-as.data.frame(prev_subst_dist)\n```\n\n## Pain-Tracks\n\nWhere no substrate is present, shrimp in different farming systems are likely to have the same experience so we do one pain track for all farm types. However, *P. monodon* burrow more than *P. vannamei* so we do species-specific pain-tracks, one for *P. vannamei* and other penaeids and one for *P. monodon*, then weight by the proportion of farmed shrimp that are that species or group. *P. monodon* would usually burrow for around half the day in the wild.\n\n![](images/substrate.png)\n\nDurations marked \\* assume death from cannibalism happens once every four weeks and causes one minute of excruciating and disabling pain together when it does.\n\n```{r}\ndur_subst<-12\n\npain_subst_vannamei<-data.frame(\n  Excruciating = 0,\n  Disabling = 0) %>%\n  cbind(sample_dirichlet(0, 0, 2, 98)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories) \n\npain_subst_monodon<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.0025, 0.0025, 29.995, 70)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n```\n\nCombine the intensity and duration information and weight by the proportion of farmed shrimp that are that species or group.\n\n```{r}\npaintrack_subst_vannamei<-(dur_subst * pain_subst_vannamei * (prop_allspecies_dof$van_prop+prop_allspecies_dof$otherpen_prop))\n\npaintrack_subst_monodon<-(dur_subst * pain_subst_monodon * prop_allspecies_dof$mon_prop)\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Duration notes\n\nIf no substrate is present, this will be the case for 100% of a shrimp's life.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\n*P. monodon* shrimp burrow daily in the wild ([FAO, 2023](https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W?type=standard)), so having no burrowable substrate probably behaviorally deprives them significantly. It is less clear to what extent *P. vannamei* burrow.\n\nWe, therefore, attribute most pain from a lack of substrate to 'annoying', with a small portion attributed to 'hurtful'. For *P. monodon*, we attribute half of the pain to 'hurtful' to account for not being able to express species-typical behaviors. We assign a tiny portion to 'disabling' and 'excruciating' because cannibalism incidences may be more common when no substrate is present, even at the same stocking density ([Abdussamad & Thampy, 1994](https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5)).\n:::\n\nWeight the pain tracks by prevalence estimations and proportion of farming attributable to each farm type, as well as the average days lived by a shrimp.\n\n```{r}\nsubst_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext*average_days_lived,\n  semi = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi*average_days_lived,\n  int = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$Intensive*prop_sample$Int*average_days_lived,\n  super = (paintrack_subst_vannamei+paintrack_subst_monodon)*prev_subst$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super*average_days_lived)\n```\n\nAdd the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n```{r}\nsubst<-subst_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_subst <- subst %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_subst$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_subst$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_subst$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_subst$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_subst$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\nsubst_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_subst$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_subst))\nrow.names(subst_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_subst\",\"Hurtful_subst\",\"Disabling_subst\", \"Excruciating_subst\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_Lack_of_substrate\")\nshow_table(subst_summary)\n\n```\n\n# Predators\n\n## Prevalence\n\nWe were unable to find estimates of the incidence of predators or data on how much mortality predators typically cause.

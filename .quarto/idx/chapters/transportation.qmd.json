Therefore, we think extensive farms are very unlikely to use waterless transportation, semi-intensive are somewhat likely, and intensive and super-intensive are very likely, though we are most uncertain about semi-intensive and intensive farms. We then weight these prevalences by the proportion of shrimp who are broodstock and the proportion that are sold live (which we estimate to be around 2%).\n\nNot all broodstock are transported every year, some are found in domestic hatcheries, so we multiply the broodstock proportion by a distribution between 0.2 to 0.5 to account for this.\n\nOur prevalence estimates are:\n\n| **Extensive**    | **Semi-intensive** | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 0--10% (mean 5%) | 0--50% (mean 25%)  | 50--100% (mean 75%) | 80--100% (mean 90%) |\n\n```{r}\n#| layout-ncol: 4\n\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.05, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.1)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.25, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.5)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.75, tol=1e-6, \n                   fifth_percentile=0.5, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.9, tol=1e-6, \n                   fifth_percentile=0.8, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n```{r}\nprev_nowater_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.05, 0.25, 0.75, 0.9),\n                               sd = c(0.0368478, 0.1727593, 0.1725248, 0.07310057))\nprev_nowater_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_nowater_stat$mean, prev_nowater_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_nowater_dist)<-prev_nowater_stat$FarmType\n\nprev_nowater_unadjusted<-as.data.frame(prev_nowater_dist)\n\n\nsold_live<-runif(n, min=0.01, max=0.02)\nbroodstock_transported<-runif(n, min=0.2, max=0.5)\nWaterless_Population_Proportion=((female_broodstock_prop*2)*broodstock_transported)+sold_live # adding shrimp who are sold live (estimated to be between 1% to 5% of shrimp) to proportion of broodstock (calculated as proportion of broodstock that are female, multiplied by two)\nplot(density(Waterless_Population_Proportion))\n\nprev_nowater<-prev_nowater_unadjusted*Waterless_Population_Proportion\n\n```\n\n## Pain-Tracks\n\nOur hypothesized pain category allocations are as follows:\n\n![](images/waterless.png)\n\n```{r}\ndur_nowater = rtruncnorm(n, a=4, b=72, mean=30, sd = 8)\n\npain_nowater<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.03, 0.06, 39, 60.91)) %>%\n  `colnames<-`(paincategories)\n\n```\n\nCombine the intensity and duration information\n\n```{r}\npaintrack_nowater<-(dur_nowater * pain_nowater)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Duration notes\n\nWe estimate a rough total shipment time as 15-35 hours.

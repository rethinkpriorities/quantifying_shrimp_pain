(2018)](http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158) found that shrimp show no heart rate after around four minutes in ice slurry.

Tail-flicking is a reflex---when shrimp' abdomens are removed from the rest of their body, they still show tail-flicking activity ([Weineck et al., 2018](http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158)). As such, it is unlikely to be, by itself, a reliable indicator of pain. However, that does not necessarily mean that the individual cannot consciously experience it.\n\nThe salinity of ice slurry is also likely to be different from that of the pond. Given that shrimp can detect cold ([Tani & Kuramoto, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1095-6433(98)01025-3)) and are likely to be stressed from being out of the pond and in an environment of different temperature and salinity, we assign most pain to 'hurtful' and 'disabling'.\n:::\n\nFinally, we combine the prevalence, intensity, and duration estimates.\n\n```{r}\nslaught_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext = paintrack_slaught_ext*prev_slaught$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext,\n  semi = paintrack_slaught_semi*prev_slaught$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi,\n  int = paintrack_slaught_int*prev_slaught$Intensive*prop_sample$Int,\n  super = paintrack_slaught_super*prev_slaught$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super)\n```\n\nAdd the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n```{r}\nslaught<-slaught_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_slaught <- slaught %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_slaught$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\nslaught_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_slaught$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_slaught$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_slaught))\nrow.names(slaught_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_slaught\",\"Hurtful_slaught\",\"Disabling_slaught\", \"Excruciating_slaught\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_Ice-Slurry_slaughter\")\nshow_table(slaught_summary)\n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| output: false\n#| eval: true\n\nharvest<-c(\"harvest_summary\", \"slaught_summary\")\n\nfor (i in 1:length(harvest)){\n  savefile<-paste0(paste0(\"../results/\", harvest[i]), \".csv\")\n  write.csv(get(harvest[i]), file=savefile)\n}\n\n```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n{{< include _functions_data.qmd >}}\n\n\n\n# Harvest\n\nHere, we are evaluating any collection method that does not kill the shrimp before removing them from the ponds or tanks nor pumps them directly to slaughter.

SWP currently estimate they have helped 1.2 billion shrimp by providing electrical stunners---that's 0.3% of the number of penaeids slaughtered per year:\n\n```{r}\n\nslaughtered_samp<-read.csv(file=\"../data/slaughtered_samples.csv\") # from Guesstimate model\nslaughtered_samp<-slaughtered_samp[,1:3] # keep only penaeids\n\n# sum across rows\nslaughtered_samp_totals<-slaughtered_samp %>% \n  mutate(total=vannamei + monodon + other_pen)\n\n(1200000000/mean(slaughtered_samp_totals$total))*100\n\n``` \n\nShrimp who are sold live are not slaughtered so we must account for this in our estimations. We, therefore, estimate that all farm types are 98% likely to use ice slurry to slaughter shrimp. We then account for the fact that only shrimp who make it slaughter age and do not die during collection are slaughtered. To do this, we weight by the relevant life-stage proportions, and by our estimate that between 0% and 50% of shrimp die during collection, before slaughter.\n\nOur prevalence estimates are:\n\n|                                            |               |                    |               |                     |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                            | **Extensive** | **Semi-intensive** | **Intensive** | **Super-intensive** |\n| Prevalence of using ice slurry             | 50--90%       | 60--95%            | 98--100%      | 100%                |\n| Die before slaughter on farms that use ice | 0--50%        | 0--50%             | 0--25%        | 0%                  |\n\n\n\nFirst, we draw from the beta distribution for the prevalence of using ice slurry:\n```{r}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.7, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.5, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.9)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.775, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.6, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.95)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.9885, tol=1e-6, sd_val=0.1,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.98, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.997)\n```\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n```{r}\nprev_iceslurry_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.7, 0.775, 0.9885, 0.99999),\n                               sd = c(0.1242302, 0.1117355, 0.00561642, 0.00001))\nprev_iceslurry_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_iceslurry_stat$mean, prev_iceslurry_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_iceslurry_dist)<-prev_iceslurry_stat$FarmType\nprev_iceslurry_dist[,4]<-1\n```\n\nThen, the prevalence of shrimp that die after harvest, before slaughter.\n\n```{r}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.25, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.5)\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.125, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0, ninety_fifth_percentile=0.25)\n\nprev_slaught_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.25, 0.25, 0.125, 0.00001),\n                               sd = c(0.1735919, 0.1735919, 0.09051201, 0.00001))\nprev_slaught_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_slaught_stat$mean, prev_slaught_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_slaught_dist)<-prev_slaught_stat$FarmType\nprev_slaught_dist[,4]<-1 # as we are multiplying with the ice slurry prevalences, we cannot set this to 0, as the calculation would not work.

(2018)](http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158) found that shrimp show no heart rate after around four minutes in ice slurry. We increase the maximum time it could take to seven minutes to account for the fact that ice used on farms may be slightly warmer than in laboratory conditions.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\nWhether shrimp feel pain during ice slurry slaughter is highly uncertain. *P. vannamei* shrimp tail-flick vigorously after being submerged in the ice slurry ([Weineck et al., 2018](http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158)). Tail-flicking is a reflex---when shrimp' abdomens are removed from the rest of their body, they still show tail-flicking activity ([Weineck et al., 2018](http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158)). As such, it is unlikely to be, by itself, a reliable indicator of pain. However, that does not necessarily mean that the individual cannot consciously experience it.\n\nThe salinity of ice slurry is also likely to be different from that of the pond. Given that shrimp can detect cold ([Tani & Kuramoto, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1095-6433(98)01025-3)) and are likely to be stressed from being out of the pond and in an environment of different temperature and salinity, we assign most pain to 'hurtful' and 'disabling'.\n:::\n\nFinally, we combine the prevalence, intensity, and duration estimates.\n\n```{r}\nslaught_farms<-data.frame(\n  ext

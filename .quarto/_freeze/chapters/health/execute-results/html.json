We assume that eyestalk ablation becomes more common in more intensive systems because these systems are far more likely to rely on captive broodstock than wild-caught shrimp. Still, the prevalence is unlikely to be 100% for intensive and super-intensive farms because some broodstock suppliers have stopped using eyestalk ablation ([Albalat et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024)). We are less certain to what extent semi-intensive farms use captive broodstock. Traditionally, extensive systems relied more on wild-caught young shrimp, so we are less certain how prevalent eyestalk ablation is in this farm type.\n\nOur prevalence estimates are:\n\n| **Extensive**       | **Semi-intensive**  | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive** |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 25--100% (mean 75%) | 50--100% (mean 75%) | 90--100% (mean 98%) | 90--100% (mean 98%) |\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"3\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.75, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.25, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.2914784\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.75, tol=1e-6,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.5, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1733532\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfind_good_sd_binary(mean_val=0.98, tol=1e-6, sd_val=0.1,\n                   fifth_percentile=0.9, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.05873486\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSampling from beta distribution:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprev_ablation_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(\n  \"Extensive\", \"Semi-Intensive\",\"Intensive\",\"Super-Intensive\"),\n                               mean = c(0.75, 0.75, 0.98, 0.98),\n                               sd = c(0.2914784, 0.1733532, 0.05873486, 0.05873486))\nprev_ablation_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_ablation_stat$mean, prev_ablation_stat$sd)\ncolnames(prev_ablation_dist)<-prev_ablation_stat$FarmType\n\nprev_ablation_unadjusted<-as.data.frame(prev_ablation_dist)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also need to adjust for the fact that only female broodstock are subjected to eyestalk ablation, not their offspring who are actually raised for food.

(2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034) noted that erratic swimming continued for an hour after ablation.\n\n**Chronic pain (Part 2)** To be conservative, we assume that chronic pain lasts only four days, on average, with a range up to 10 days. We truncate the lower bound at 0 hours, to account for the possibility that shrimp do not experience chronic pain from eyestalk ablation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Intensity notes\n\nWe assume severity is the same in each production style, conditional on being ablated. This assumption may be violated if the method for ablating shrimp varies in pain severity and is correlated with production style.\n\n**Acute pain (Part 1)** We base our estimates on the findings from [our previous report](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV):\n\n> After having one eyestalk ablated, shrimp display several behaviors potentially indicative of pain, like tail-flicking, recoiling, stooping (laying prone on the pond floor), disorientation, avoiding sheltering, erratic swimming and rubbing the affected area for a period of time after ablation ([Diarte-Plata et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002); [Barr et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.004); [Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)). In particular, [Diarte-Plata et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002) report that ligation, even using a local anesthetic, causes more stress than other techniques, as indicated by significantly more tail-flicking, recoil, disorientation, and rubbing of the affected area. Additionally, up to 80% of the studied shrimp displayed similar behaviors when a slitting ablation method was used. Similarly, in [Taylor et al.'s (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034) study, 80% of the shrimp exhibited erratic swimming behavior right after the animals had one of their eyes ablated. Shrimp show fewer behavioral signs of stress if a topical anesthetic is applied before ablation ([Diarte-Plata et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002); [Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)).\n\nMany of these behaviors seem consistent with 'hurtful' and 'disabling' pain, so we assign most of the pain to these categories. We also include a small proportion in 'excruciating' because mortality is higher in ablated females ([Zacarias et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.01.018)).\n\n**Chronic pain (Part 2)** This follows directly after part 1 pain. We assume that the pain is much milder but also longer-lasting.\n\nAs behavior returns to normal roughly an hour after ablation ([Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)), we assign most of the chronic pain to the 'annoying' category. We still leave some in the other pain categories because some mortality of ablated broodstock likely happens during the chronic pain stage.\n:::\n\nNow we combine the Pain-Tracks with prevalence.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nablation_farms<-data.frame(ext = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext,\n                   semi = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi,\n                   int = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$Intensive*prop_sample$Int,\n                   super = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we combine the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nablation<-ablation_farms %>%\n  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,\n         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,\n         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,\n         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)\n\naverage_hours_ablation <- ablation %>%\n  select(starts_with(\"allfarms\"))\n\naverage_hours_ablation$Disabling_Equivalent<- (\n  average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (\n    average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(\n      average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(\n        average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)\n\nablation_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), \n  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),\n  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),\n  \"Mean\" = colMeans(average_hours_ablation))\nrow.names(ablation_summary)<-c(\n  \"Annoying_ablation\",\"Hurtful_ablation\",\"Disabling_ablation\", \"Excruciating_ablation\", \"Disabling-Equivalent_Eyestalk_ablation\")\nshow_table(ablation_summary)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table data-quarto-disable-processing=\"true\" class=\"table table-condensed\" style=\"font-size: 12px; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5% </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 50% </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 95% </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Mean </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Annoying_ablation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.54e-05 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0002542 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0005995 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.89e-04 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Hurtful_ablation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9.70e-06 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000279 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000739 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3.31e-05 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disabling_ablation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6.00e-07 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000031 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.60e-06 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Excruciating_ablation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.00e+00 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.00e+00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Disabling-Equivalent_Eyestalk_ablation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2.60e-06 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000066 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0000200 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.17e-05 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Biosecurity failures\n\nHere, we are evaluating shrimp suffering from diseases cause only by biosecurity failures on a farm.

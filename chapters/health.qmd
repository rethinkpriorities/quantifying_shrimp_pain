# Eyestalk ablation

We split eyestalk ablation into two categories: The ablation itself and the hour immediately afterward (acute pain), and the week after that (chronic pain).

## Prevalence

An estimate we will use for both parts is how often eyestalk ablation occurs in each production system. We assume that eyestalk ablation becomes more common in more intensive systems because these systems are far more likely to rely on captive broodstock than wild-caught shrimp. Still, the prevalence is unlikely to be 100% for intensive and super-intensive farms because some broodstock suppliers have stopped using eyestalk ablation ([Albalat et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024)). We are less certain to what extent semi-intensive farms use captive broodstock. Traditionally, extensive systems relied more on wild-caught young shrimp, so we are less certain how prevalent eyestalk ablation is in this farm type.

Our prevalence estimates are:

| **Extensive**       | **Semi-intensive**  | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive** |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 25--100% (mean 75%) | 50--100% (mean 75%) | 90--100% (mean 98%) | 90--100% (mean 98%) |

                   fifth_percentile=0.9, ninety_fifth_percentile=1)
```

Sampling from beta distribution:

```{r}
prev_ablation_stat <- data.frame(FarmType = c(
  "Extensive", "Semi-Intensive","Intensive","Super-Intensive"),
                               mean = c(0.75, 0.75, 0.98, 0.98),
                               sd = c(0.2914784, 0.1733532, 0.05873486, 0.05873486))
prev_ablation_dist<-mapply(sample_beta, prev_ablation_stat$mean, prev_ablation_stat$sd)
colnames(prev_ablation_dist)<-prev_ablation_stat$FarmType

prev_ablation_unadjusted<-as.data.frame(prev_ablation_dist)
```

We also need to adjust for the fact that only female broodstock are subjected to eyestalk ablation, not their offspring who are actually raised for food. We calculate the number of broodstock by using the total number of shrimp that die on farms *from the postlarval stage onward* (from [Waldhorn & Autric's 2023](http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t) Guesstimate model), divided by the number of eggs different species lay per spawn, and assuming only half the eggs hatch.

See [set up chapter](set-up.qmd) for how the variables used here were calculated. First, we must calculate the number of shrimp that die on farms from the postlarval stage onward. We do so because other threats are evaluated for the harms they cause in the ongrowing stage only, so we must calculate the proportion of shrimp that are broodstock against only this population. We do so handling the data in the same way as the Set-up chapter, using the `kde1d` function to generate 100,000 samples.

```{r}
library(kde1d) # load the required package

allspecies_dof<-as.data.frame(allspecies_dof) # load the estimations for number of shrimp that die on farms, calculated in the set-up chapter

# load mortality samples to calculate larval mortality rates for each species
vannamei_mort_samp<-read.csv("../data/vannamei_mortality_rates.csv",header=TRUE, sep=",") # Cells UY, UJ, and TF in the Guesstimate model
monodon_mort_samp<-read.csv("../data/monodon_mortality_rates.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",") # Cells ZA, XZ, and YR in the Guesstimate model
otherpen_mort_samp<-read.csv("../data/otherpen_mortality_rates.csv", header=TRUE,sep=",")
 # Cells MU, UQ, and XJ in the Guesstimate model

vannamei_larval_prob<-data.frame(larval=rep(NA, 100000)) # create empty data frame

# fill empty data frame with data simulated from Guesstimate data using kde1d function
vannamei_larval_prob$larval<-vannamei_mort_samp$larval %>% 
  kde1d(xmin = 0,
        xmax = 1) %>% # Probabilities cannot be less than 0 or more than 1 so we add these as xmin and xmax
  rkde1d(100000,.)

# repeat for other taxa
monodon_larval_prob<-data.frame(larval=rep(NA, 100000))
monodon_larval_prob$larval<-monodon_mort_samp$larval %>% 
  kde1d(xmin = 0, 
        xmax = 1) %>%
  rkde1d(100000,.)
otherpen_larval_prob<-data.frame(larval=rep(NA, 100000))
otherpen_larval_prob$larval<-otherpen_mort_samp$larval %>% 
  kde1d(xmin = 0, 
        xmax = 1) %>%
  rkde1d(100000,.)

# calculate the number of shrimp that die on farms after the larval stage for each species
vannamei_dof_pl<-allspecies_dof$vannamei_dof*(1-vannamei_larval_prob$larval)
monodon_dof_pl<-allspecies_dof$monodon_dof*(1-monodon_larval_prob$larval)
otherpen_dof_pl<-allspecies_dof$otherpen_dof*(1-otherpen_larval_prob$larval)
```

We now have the number of shrimp that die on farms, both in total and from the postlarval stage onward. Next, we can estimate the number of broodstock that would have been needed to produce the total number of shrimp that died on farms, and calculate that number of broodstock as a proportion of our population of interest (shrimp in the ongrowing stage).
```{r}
# distribution of egg numbers
vannamei_eggs<-runif(100000, min=100000, max=250000) # according to FAO
vannamei_broodstock<-allspecies_dof$vannamei_dof/vannamei_eggs*0.5 # assuming only half of eggs hatch. 
vannamei_broodstock_prop<-vannamei_broodstock/(vannamei_broodstock+allspecies_dof$vannamei_dof)

monodon_eggs<-runif(100000, min=500000, max=750000) # according to FAO
monodon_broodstock<-allspecies_dof$monodon_dof/monodon_eggs*0.5
monodon_broodstock_prop<-monodon_broodstock/(monodon_broodstock+allspecies_dof$monodon_dof)

otherpen_eggs<-runif(100000, min=200000, max=1000000) # according to Table 4.6a, Wickins and Lee (2002)
otherpen_broodstock<-allspecies_dof$otherpen_dof/otherpen_eggs*0.5
otherpen_broodstock_prop<-otherpen_broodstock/(otherpen_broodstock+allspecies_dof$otherpen_dof)

female_broodstock<-(vannamei_broodstock+monodon_broodstock+otherpen_broodstock)

female_broodstock_prop<-(female_broodstock/((female_broodstock*2)+vannamei_dof_pl+monodon_dof_pl+otherpen_dof_pl)) # we multiply the number of female broodstock by two in our calculation of the shrimp population to account for male broodstock

head(female_broodstock_prop) # the proportion of shrimp that are female broodstock.

# multiply proportion of farms that source larvae from ablated broodstock by proportion of shrimp on those farms that are broodstock. This gives you the proportion of farmed broodstock that are ablated shrimp.
prev_ablation<-prev_ablation_unadjusted*female_broodstock_prop

saveRDS(female_broodstock_prop, file="../data/female_broodstock_prop.RData")
```

We can also see the average number of female broodstock.
```{r}
mean(female_broodstock)
```

## Pain-Tracks

![](images/ablation.png)

```{r}


first_dur_ablation<-sample_trunclogn(n, 1, .5, 1/12, 2)  
plot(density(first_dur_ablation), xlab="Hours", main="Duration of acute eyestalk ablation pain")
quantile(first_dur_ablation, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))

first_pain_ablation<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.1, 55, 35, 9.9)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(paincategories)

```

Then for the second half:

```{r}

# 168 hours in a week, sample from log-normal for consistency
sec_dur_ablation<-sample_trunclogn(n=n, min_value=0, max_value=240, mean=120, sd=72)
plot(density(sec_dur_ablation) , main="Duration of chronic eyestalk ablation pain", xlab="Hours")
quantile(sec_dur_ablation, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))

sec_pain_ablation<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.002, 0.004, 10, 89.994)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(paincategories)


```

Combine into Pain-Tracks:

```{r}
paintrack_ablation<-(first_dur_ablation * first_pain_ablation) + (
  sec_dur_ablation * sec_pain_ablation)

```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Duration notes

Time can't be lower than 0, and a long right tail may be more plausible than a symmetric distribution, so we use a log-normal distribution for both types of pain.

**Acute pain (Part 1)** [Taylor et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034) noted that erratic swimming continued for an hour after ablation.

**Chronic pain (Part 2)** To be conservative, we assume that chronic pain lasts only four days, on average, with a range up to 10 days. We truncate the lower bound at 0 hours, to account for the possibility that shrimp do not experience chronic pain from eyestalk ablation.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Intensity notes

We assume severity is the same in each production style, conditional on being ablated. This assumption may be violated if the method for ablating shrimp varies in pain severity and is correlated with production style.

**Acute pain (Part 1)** We base our estimates on the findings from [our previous report](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV):

> After having one eyestalk ablated, shrimp display several behaviors potentially indicative of pain, like tail-flicking, recoiling, stooping (laying prone on the pond floor), disorientation, avoiding sheltering, erratic swimming and rubbing the affected area for a period of time after ablation ([Diarte-Plata et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002); [Barr et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.004); [Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)). In particular, [Diarte-Plata et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002) report that ligation, even using a local anesthetic, causes more stress than other techniques, as indicated by significantly more tail-flicking, recoil, disorientation, and rubbing of the affected area. Additionally, up to 80% of the studied shrimp displayed similar behaviors when a slitting ablation method was used. Similarly, in [Taylor et al.'s (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034) study, 80% of the shrimp exhibited erratic swimming behavior right after the animals had one of their eyes ablated. Shrimp show fewer behavioral signs of stress if a topical anesthetic is applied before ablation ([Diarte-Plata et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002); [Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)).

Many of these behaviors seem consistent with 'hurtful' and 'disabling' pain, so we assign most of the pain to these categories. We also include a small proportion in 'excruciating' because mortality is higher in ablated females ([Zacarias et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.01.018)).

**Chronic pain (Part 2)** This follows directly after part 1 pain. We assume that the pain is much milder but also longer-lasting.

As behavior returns to normal roughly an hour after ablation ([Taylor et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034)), we assign most of the chronic pain to the 'annoying' category. We still leave some in the other pain categories because some mortality of ablated broodstock likely happens during the chronic pain stage.
:::

Now we combine the Pain-Tracks with prevalence.

```{r}
ablation_farms<-data.frame(ext = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$Extensive*prop_sample$Ext,
                   semi = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$`Semi-Intensive`*prop_sample$Semi,
                   int = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$Intensive*prop_sample$Int,
                   super = paintrack_ablation*prev_ablation$`Super-Intensive`*prop_sample$Super)
```

Finally, we combine the pain categories across farm types and calculate the disabling-equivalent pain hours.

```{r}
ablation<-ablation_farms %>%
  mutate(allfarms.Annoying = ext.Annoying + semi.Annoying + int.Annoying + super.Annoying,
         allfarms.Hurtful = ext.Hurtful + semi.Hurtful + int.Hurtful + super.Hurtful,
         allfarms.Disabling = ext.Disabling + semi.Disabling + int.Disabling + super.Disabling,
         allfarms.Excruciating = ext.Excruciating + semi.Excruciating + int.Excruciating + super.Excruciating,)

average_hours_ablation <- ablation %>%
  select(starts_with("allfarms"))

average_hours_ablation$Disabling_Equivalent<- (
  average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Annoying*Annoying_Weight) + (
    average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Hurtful*Hurtful_Weight) +(
      average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Disabling*Disabling_Weight)+(
        average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Excruciating*Excruciating_Weight)

ablation_summary<-cbind(round(rbind(
  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Annoying, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), 
  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Hurtful, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))), 
  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Disabling, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),
  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$allfarms.Excruciating, probs = c(.05, .50, .95))),
  (quantile(x =average_hours_ablation$Disabling_Equivalent, probs = c(.05, .50, .95)))), 10),
  "Mean" = colMeans(average_hours_ablation))
row.names(ablation_summary)<-c(
  "Annoying_ablation","Hurtful_ablation","Disabling_ablation", "Excruciating_ablation", "Disabling-Equivalent_Eyestalk_ablation")
kable(ablation_summary, table.attr = 'data-quarto-disable-processing="true"', digits=10) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width=FALSE, position="center", font_size=12,
                  bootstrap_options = c("condensed")) # the show_table function defaults to 7 decimal places, but our results here are smaller than that so we manually show the results with an updated "digits" value



```

# Biosecurity failures

Here, we are evaluating shrimp suffering from diseases cause only by biosecurity failures on a farm. This welfare threat does not get credit for all of the welfare issues associated with diseases, but only diseases that cannot be explained by other factors. Biosecurity failures may include using a contaminated water source, equipment or feed, or not preventing wild animals (e.g., birds or insects) from transmitting a disease.

## Prevalence

14.5% of *P. vannamei* and 32.5% of *P. monodon* shrimp die pre-slaughter in the ongrowing stage ([McKay & McAuliffe, 2024. Table 1](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/W7MUZ)). In our estimates of the average days lived by a shrimp (see @sec-preslaughtmort), \~16.8% of *P. vannamei*, *P. monodon*, and other penaeid shrimp die in the ongrowing stage prior to slaughter:

```{r}
mean(stage_probabilities[,2])
```

Here, we hypothesize that half of these are from diseases. This would mean roughly 8.4% of shrimp die from diseases. Potentially, some diseases are never noticed or are treated and shrimp do not die from them (though many shrimp viruses cause significant losses). On the other hand, some diseases instances will be caused by other welfare issues (e.g., physiological stress from nonoptimal water quality), which we are not counting here. As such, we estimate that 5--20% of shrimp . We think diseases are most prevalent in semi-intensive farms as they have reasonably high stocking densities but fewer resources to put into biosecurity measures.

The numbers in the table below equate to roughly 5--20% of shrimp overall when considering the proportions of farm types.

| **Extensive**       | **Semi-intensive**     | **Intensive**       | **Super-intensive**  |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 5--20% (mean 12.5%) | 5.5--30% (mean 17.75%) | 5--18% (mean 11.5%) | 0.5--5% (mean 2.75%) |

## Pain-Tracks

We model mostly on information about White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) and Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND), as many sources report that these have most negatively impacted industry production, suggesting they are the most prevalent. While [Flegel (2019, Fig. 3)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12589) shows that the impact of AHPND on production was most severe, WSSV has been present for much longer (since \~1996) and shrimp are still affected today, so we weight each equally.We combine these into one pain track by multiplying each by half (since most shrimp die from these diseases, its likely they do not experience both).

![](images/diseases.png)

AHPND duration and pain:

```{r}
ahpnd_dur_disease<-runif(n, 12, 600)

ahpnd_pain_disease<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.01, 10, 80, 9.99)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(paincategories)

WSSV duration and pain:

```{r}
wssv_dur_disease<-runif(n, 72, 240)

wssv_pain_disease<-data.frame(sample_dirichlet(0.05, 30, 50, 19.95)) %>%
  `colnames<-`(paincategories)

```

Combine into Pain-Tracks:

```{r}

  wssv_dur_disease * wssv_pain_disease * 0.5)

### Duration notes

**AHPND** [Tran et al. (2014, p. 14)](https://perma.cc/K2G9-CBLB) note that "With regards to the EMS/AHPND, our studies show that shrimp exhibit very acute mortality as early as 12 hours of exposure to the agent." [WOAH (2023, Ch. 2.2.1, p. 2)](https://perma.cc/2X3E-T9TF) notes that mass mortalities occur within 30--35 days of stocking the pond and that signs of disease can occur as early as 10 days post--stocking. We take 25 days as our upper bound, which is 600 hours

**WSSV** [WOAH (2023, Ch. 2.2.8, p.3)](https://perma.cc/UR3K-99VY) reports "A very high mortality rate in the shrimp population can be expected within a few days of the onset of behavioral signs" -- we therefore put duration at 3 to 10 days
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Intensity notes

**AHPND** A behavioral sign is dropping to the bottom of the pond, while physiological signs are soft shells and pigment loss in the connective tissue.

**WSSV** Symptoms include [(WOAH, 2023, Ch. 2.2.8, p.3)](https://perma.cc/UR3K-99VY):

-   Lethargy
-   Reduced or ceased feeding
-   Abnormal swimming (slow, on the side, near water surface or round edges of pond)
-   Loosened attachment of the carapace
-    Delayed hemolymph clotting
